This program will prompt the user for a number of threads to open, and then the number of darts to throw in each thread.

It will use the data collected for each dart that landed in the target area to calculate pi.

It now includes a timer that will record how long it takes to open each thread, throw each dart, and then calculate pi
before printing the time in milliseconds and the calulated pi.
